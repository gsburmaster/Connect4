My Connect Four Project for EECS 368 at KU
This is a final project for my EECS 368 class. Our assignment was simply to create a non-trivial program in JS or Haskell. 
My code isn't terribly optimized, nor is it pretty, but it does work, and this project is a solo one, so thorough documentation isn't necessary.
